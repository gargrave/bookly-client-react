# Bookly Client (React)

This is a rebuild of the front end for my app **Bookly**. You can find the mostly-complete version I have already built with Vue/Quasar [here](https://github.com/gargrave/bookly-client). This project will effectively have all of the same features as that one, albeit built with React. I am mostly just building this because I want to try out `create-react-app` in a slightly larger project without having to worry about building a new API.

As of right now, I have a great deal of work to do, and there is not a whole lot to see here, so as they say: move along, citizen.

(You can give the existing version of the app a whirl [here](https://www.bookly-app.us) or view the back end codebase (Hapi) [here](https://github.com/gargrave/bookly-server)).
